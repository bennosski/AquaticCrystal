# AquaticCrystal

A simulation illustrating the behavior of waves propagating through a crystal with band gaps in 1D and 2D. 
Waves with a frequency within a band can propagate through the crystal, while waves with a frequency lying in a band gap are reflected.
Inspired by the physics of photonic band gap crystal fibers.
