# AquaticCrystal

A simulation illustrating the behavior of waves propagating through a crystal with band gaps in 1D and 2D. 
Waves with frequencies within a band can propagate through the crystal, while waves with frequencies lying in a band gap are reflected.
Inspired by the physics of photonic band gap crystal fibers.
